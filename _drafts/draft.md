CADD (/kad/)
: abbreviation - computer-aided design and drafting.

We need to push forward the "design" portion of CADD. I believe one of the next steps forward, especially in the Civil 
Engineering sub-discipline, is complete integration of GIS technology into our CADD programs.

With our current situation, if I'm designing a proposed development in CADD software and I want to perform some area or 
geography based calculations, the general useful properties I have access to are purely spatial-- location, distance, 
area, or volume. The problem is, the practical world consists of a lot more! 

Sure, CAD programs may allow us to assign some additional properties to line work and meshes. However there's no 
practical way to process this into a quality product of useful information for yourself or a client. If we want to do 
this, we can export our geometry into the appropriate files and process/merge our files with the appropriate GIS data 
and software. Sure this sounds easy enough, and it is. However, what happens when you start updating and iteratively 
designing? It becomes less and less practical to keep exporting and reprocessing your data to get to the same spot as 
your first iteration, with new numbers. Plans and design production
