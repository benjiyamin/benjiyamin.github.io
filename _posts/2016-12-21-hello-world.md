Here's the thing: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) was crazy easy to set up and I figured this blog could serve a few 
purposes:

1. I vent enough where I feel less need to debate everyone about every small thing,
2. I channel some of the imaginary, hypothetical arguments I have with myself in the shower into a productive medium, 
and/or
3. I learn something new about an idea because I'm forcing myself to actively elaborate on it.

Either way, I hope I actually follow through with this-- I mean this blog. The thing is that I have a hard time 
finishing with things. It's not my strongest trait. I'm aware it's something ~~I should focus on~~ on which I should focus. 

Some TODOs I'm setting for myself for the near future:

- Blog post pagination amd search, of course.
- A comment section for each post, so the trolls have a safe place from which to attack.
- Share buttons for each post, so people have something to not click.
- Tags, because I think I'm supposed to have them.

I'm probably only writing this because it's 9:45PM, I've been at work for the last 15 hours, and I desperately needed a 
15 minute break.
