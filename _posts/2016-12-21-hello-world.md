Here's the thing: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) was crazy easy to set up and I figured this blog could serve a few purposes:

1. I feel less need to debate everyone about every small thing,
2. I channel some of the imaginary, hypothetical arguments I have with myself in the shower into a medium where I don't feel like a total freak, and/or
3. I learn something new about an idea because I'm forcing myself to actively elaborate on it.

Either way, I hope I actually follow through with this-- I mean this blog. The thing is that I have a hard time finishing through with things. I start A LOT of stuff but I never really feel like it's work until it comes time to actually end it. It's not my strongest trait, but at least I'm always trying to get better.

Some TODOs I'm setting for myself for the near future:

- Blog post pagination amd search, obviously.
- A comment section for each post, so the trolls have a safe place from which to attack.
- Share buttons for each post, so people have something to not click.
- Tags, because I think I'm supposed to have them.

I'm probably only writing this because it's 9:45PM, I've been at work for the last 15 hours, and I desperately needed a 15 minute break.
