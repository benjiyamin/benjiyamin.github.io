title: Get Subjectivity out of Politics
subTitle: The Real Reason the Electoral College Sucks
---

Post-election mania is continuing and one of the biggest arguments is the state of our Electoral College system and the 
push to abolish it. Watching Fox News and CNN debates on the subject usually consists of pundits agreeing or disagreeing 
over the general premise:

> If elections are purely decided by popular vote, states with higher populations have too much say over states with 
lower populations.

Now, I see where the logic of this comes in. I think most people do.

However, let's pretend for a second that the opposite side of the population spectrum was our current system. Let's say 
the candidate upon winning a state got exactly 1 out of 51 votes; majority rules (can't forgot about D.C.). We would 
most definitely all agree that would take way too much power from each individual voter!

This is one of the main reasons supporters are concluding that our Electoral College system, which is somewhere in the 
middle of these two sides, is the best choice. 

The problem with this is that there's no way to objectively create "fair" numbers that give the "correct" amount of 
representation for either side. Depending on your view, either the states or the population hubs have too much power. 

The numbers we have today are based off the number of senators and representatives in its U.S. Congressional delegation. 
It's political voodoo. How do we determine that the two votes per state that we weigh in with the population-based votes 
provides just the *right* amount of weighting toward rural representation? Is one per state too little? Is three too 
much? In the words of Tyler the Creator, "WHO HAS THE ANSWERS??"

Nobody does.

The arguments go back and forth. We've somehow applied the logic that the numbers we've determined that are appropriate 
for congressional representation are also conveniently suitable for the votes of our president.

To review, our three choices that we've discussed are thus:

1. Electoral College
2. Equal votes per state
3. Popular vote

Ive already discussed why the Electoral College has been a bad idea. Its subjectivity is its key downfall. The second 
option **is** objective, but takes power from the individual on a level that is far too illogical. We already have a 
system that leaves people feeling like their vote doesn't matter; I could imagine even less enthusiasm in the cities 
under this system. This leaves the popular vote option as the only system that is logical, feasible, and truly objective.
