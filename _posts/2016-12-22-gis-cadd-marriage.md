CADD (/kad/)
: abbreviation - computer-aided design and drafting.

We need to push forward the "design" portion of CADD. I believe one of the next steps forward, especially in the Civil 
Engineering sub-discipline, is complete integration of GIS technology into our CADD programs.

With our current situation, if I'm designing a proposed development in CADD software and I want to perform some 
geography based calculations, the general useful properties I have access to are purely spatial-- location, distance, 
area, or volume. The problem is, the practical world consists of a lot more! 

If we were proceed to combine our proposed design with outside geographic information, without the need to part ways 
with the CADD program, we could **manually** account for it through use of shapes and labels. But man, my eyes get 
heavy just thinking about the massive amount of tedious work that could entail for you, your colleagues, or your 
subordinates.
 
*Time is money.*

You could say "If we choose to export our geometry into the appropriate files and process/merge data in GIS, what's the 
issue?". The deal is that I've personally never worked on a project that didn't require multiple 
iterations-- whether it's design or client driven. What happens when you start updating and iteratively designing? It 
becomes less and less practical to keep exporting and reprocessing your data to get to the same spot as your previous 
design cycle, only with new numbers.

It's too bad that GIS programs aren't great drafting tools. We can't really practically produce a good set of plans with 
them, at least not at the speed you can with 
[AutoCAD Civil 3D](http://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad-civil-3d/overview) or 
[MicroStation](https://www.bentley.com/en/products/product-line/modeling-and-visualization-software/microstation).

If our CADD software could handle the memory-based linework and mesh renderings in addition to the robust, 
database-driven properties of GIS, we could design and process geographic information seamlessly! These two 
technologies seem destined to marry one day into one package and this is something we should be following and 
putting our resources toward.
