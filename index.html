                    After graduating from Florida State University in 2012, I've practiced
                    as a Civil Engineer, designing major highways throughout Florida while 
                    obtaining licensure in two states. Throughout this time, I sought ways to 
                    automate my workflow and build tools that other engineers would come to 
                    utilize. This brought me to learn several programming languages (Visual Basic, 
                    Python, Javascript to name a few), software architechtural patterns, 
                    object-oriented programming, database management, and development frameworks 
                    in order to make life easier.
                </p>

                    I consider myself as more of a problem solver than an engineer or developer. 
                    Coding provides a way to implement the ideas that have without having to go 
                    through somebody else. I can create a tool that make somebody's life easier, 
                    automate the boring stuff, or customize / troubleshoot the existing tools that 
                    we use in our everyday lives.
